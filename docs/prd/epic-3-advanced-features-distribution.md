# Epic 3: Advanced Features & Distribution

Complete the proxy implementation with chat and embeddings support, then package for distribution. This epic delivers the remaining Ollama SDK functionality and makes the service easily deployable through multiple channels. By the end, users have a production-ready proxy service available via Docker, PyPI, or direct installation.

## Story 3.1: Implement /api/chat Endpoint

As an Ollama SDK user,
I want to have chat conversations using client.chat() method,
so that I can build conversational AI applications.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: POST /api/chat endpoint is implemented with message history support
2: Endpoint accepts messages array with role and content
3: Request validation ensures message format is correct
4: Both streaming and non-streaming modes are supported
5: Response includes assistant message with proper format
6: System messages are properly handled if present

## Story 3.2: Chat Translation Engine

As a developer,
I want to translate between Ollama and OpenAI chat formats,
so that conversations work seamlessly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Ollama messages format maps directly to OpenAI format
2: Role mappings are preserved (user, assistant, system)
3: Message content is passed through without modification
4: Chat options are translated to OpenAI parameters
5: Response includes message object with role and content
6: Translation handles multi-turn conversations correctly

## Story 3.3: Implement /api/embeddings Endpoints

As an Ollama SDK user,
I want to generate embeddings using client.embeddings() method,
so that I can create vector representations of text.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: POST /api/embeddings endpoint is implemented
2: POST /api/embed endpoint aliases to same functionality
3: Endpoint accepts model and prompt parameters
4: Request is translated to OpenAI embeddings format
5: Response returns embedding array in Ollama format
6: Both endpoints return identical responses

## Story 3.4: Embeddings Translation Engine

As a developer,
I want to translate embedding requests and responses,
so that vector operations work correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Ollama prompt is converted to OpenAI input format
2: Model name is correctly mapped
3: OpenAI embedding response is extracted to array format
4: Response contains only the embedding array as expected by Ollama
5: High-dimensional embeddings are handled without truncation
6: Unit tests verify dimension preservation

## Story 3.5: Comprehensive SDK Integration Test Suite

As a developer,
I want a complete test suite validating all Ollama SDK methods,
so that I can ensure full compatibility.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Test suite covers client.list(), generate(), chat(), and embeddings()
2: Each method is tested with multiple parameter combinations
3: Edge cases like empty prompts and long texts are tested
4: Error scenarios are validated for each endpoint
5: Performance benchmarks compare proxy overhead to direct calls
6: Test report shows 100% SDK method coverage

## Story 3.6: Docker Production Build

As a DevOps engineer,
I want production-ready Docker images,
so that I can deploy the service easily.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Dockerfile uses multi-stage build for size optimization
2: Final image is based on python:3.12-slim
3: Health check endpoint is configured in Docker
4: Image runs as non-root user for security
5: Build process is documented in README
6: Docker Compose file provided for local deployment

## Story 3.7: Python Package Distribution

As a Python developer,
I want to install the proxy via pip,
so that I can integrate it into my Python environment.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Package builds as universal wheel with proper metadata
2: Setup.py and pyproject.toml are properly configured
3: Package includes all necessary files via MANIFEST.in
4: CLI entry point allows running via 'ollama-openai-proxy' command
5: Package can be installed with 'pip install ollama-openai-proxy'
6: Documentation includes PyPI installation instructions

## Story 3.8: Documentation and Examples

As a user,
I want comprehensive documentation and examples,
so that I can quickly start using the proxy service.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: README includes quick start guide with Docker and pip options
2: Configuration options are fully documented with examples
3: Example code shows Ollama SDK usage with proxy
4: Troubleshooting section covers common issues
5: API compatibility matrix documents supported features
6: Migration guide helps users switch from Ollama to proxy
