# Requirements

## Functional

- FR1: The proxy service MUST implement the Ollama API specification endpoints to maintain compatibility with the official Ollama SDK
- FR2: The service MUST translate Ollama API requests to OpenAI API format using the official OpenAI Python SDK as a client library
- FR3: The service MUST support the `/api/tags` endpoint to list available models, translating OpenAI's `/v1/models` response to Ollama format
- FR4: The service MUST support the `/api/generate` endpoint for text generation, converting between Ollama and OpenAI completion formats
- FR5: The service MUST support the `/api/chat` endpoint for conversational interactions with message history
- FR6: The service MUST support the `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` endpoints for generating text embeddings
- FR7: The service MUST handle both streaming and non-streaming responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Ollama format
- FR8: The service MUST properly map OpenAI errors to Ollama-compatible error responses
- FR9: The service MUST support configuration via environment variables for API endpoints and authentication
- FR10: The service MUST work with any OpenAI-compatible backend by configuring the base URL
- FR11: Optional endpoints (`/api/pull`, `/api/push`, `/api/delete`) MUST return static success responses to maintain compatibility

## Non Functional

- NFR1: The service MUST be stateless with no session storage or request history
- NFR2: All endpoints MUST be tested using the official Ollama SDK to ensure compatibility
- NFR3: The service MUST achieve 100% Ollama SDK method coverage in integration tests
- NFR4: Unit test coverage MUST be at least 80% for translation logic
- NFR5: The service MUST use Python 3.12 or higher for enhanced async performance
- NFR6: The service MUST support deployment via Docker, Docker Compose, Python wheel, and PyPI
- NFR7: Response latency MUST not exceed 100ms overhead compared to direct API calls (excluding model processing time)
- NFR8: The service MUST handle streaming responses without buffering entire content
- NFR9: Error responses MUST maintain Ollama's expected error structure and status codes
- NFR10: The service MUST NOT log sensitive information including API keys or request/response bodies
- NFR11: All external inputs MUST be validated using Pydantic before processing
