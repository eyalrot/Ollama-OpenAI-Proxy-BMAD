# Project Brief: Ollama-OpenAI Proxy Service

## Executive Summary

The Ollama-OpenAI Proxy Service is a lightweight translation layer that enables existing Ollama applications to seamlessly use OpenAI-compatible API backends without any code changes. The service acts as a drop-in replacement for the Ollama API server, translating Ollama API format requests to OpenAI format and responses back to Ollama format.

**Product Concept**: A simple proxy service that bridges the gap between Ollama clients and OpenAI API providers, maintaining full compatibility with the official Ollama SDK.

**Primary Problem**: Organizations using Ollama-based applications face migration challenges when wanting to leverage OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible services, requiring significant code rewrites.

**Target Market**: Development teams and organizations with existing Ollama integrations who need to switch to OpenAI backends.

**Key Value Proposition**: Zero-code migration path from Ollama to OpenAI services while maintaining all existing application functionality.
