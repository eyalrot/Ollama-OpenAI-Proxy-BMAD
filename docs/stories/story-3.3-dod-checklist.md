## Final Confirmation

### Summary
Successfully implemented the /api/embeddings and /api/embed endpoints with full Ollama API compatibility. The implementation includes:
- Complete request/response models matching Ollama specifications
- Translation functions that properly convert between Ollama and OpenAI formats
- Comprehensive error handling for all API failure scenarios
- Full test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Preservation of high-dimensional embeddings without truncation
- Both endpoints working identically as required

### Items Not Done
All items are complete.

### Technical Debt/Follow-up
None identified. The implementation is complete and follows all project standards.

### Challenges/Learnings
- Discovered that Ollama API documentation differs slightly from the Postman collection (uses "prompt" not "input")
- Ensured embeddings are returned as a simple array in the "embedding" field, not nested

### Ready for Review
Yes, the story is ready for review. All acceptance criteria have been met, all tests are passing, and the code follows project standards.

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
