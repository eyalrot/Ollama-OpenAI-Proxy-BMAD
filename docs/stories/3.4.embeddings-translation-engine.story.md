# Story 3.4: Embeddings Translation Engine

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to translate embedding requests and responses,
**so that** vector operations work correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ollama prompt is converted to OpenAI input format
2. Model name is correctly mapped
3. OpenAI embedding response is extracted to array format
4. Response contains only the embedding array as expected by Ollama
5. High-dimensional embeddings are handled without truncation
6. Unit tests verify dimension preservation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement embeddings request translation (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Convert Ollama prompt field to OpenAI input field
  - [x] Map model names appropriately for embeddings
- [x] Implement embeddings response translation (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Extract embedding array from OpenAI response format
  - [x] Return only embedding array field as expected by Ollama
- [x] Handle high-dimensional embeddings (AC: 5)
  - [x] Ensure no truncation of large embedding vectors
  - [x] Test with various embedding dimensions (384, 768, 1536, etc.)
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test dimension preservation across different models
  - [x] Test request/response translation accuracy
  - [x] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story was merged into Story 3.3 (Implement /api/embeddings Endpoints) for implementation efficiency, as the translation logic is tightly coupled with the endpoint implementation.

### Implementation Details
[Source: docs/stories/3.3.implement-api-embeddings-endpoints.story.md]
- Translation functions created in `src/ollama_openai_proxy/services/enhanced_translation_service.py`
- Request translation: `translate_embeddings_request()` converts Ollama format (prompt → input)
- Response translation: `translate_embeddings_response()` extracts embedding array from OpenAI format
- High-dimensional embeddings preserved without truncation
- Comprehensive error handling for all OpenAI API errors

### Data Models and Translation Mapping
**Translation Mapping (Ollama → OpenAI)**:
- prompt → input (direct string mapping)
- model → model (preserve as-is)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
}
```

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Translation logic: `src/services/enhanced_translation_service.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_embeddings_translation.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_embeddings.py`

### Testing
#### Test Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test files in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Use pytest framework with pytest-asyncio for async testing
- All translation tests must verify dimension preservation
- Mock external dependencies (OpenAI service)
- 90% test coverage required
