- **CPU Usage**: 0.23% (idle) ✅

### API Response Times (via containerized proxy):
- **Chat Completion**: ~620ms (including OpenAI API call)
- **Embeddings Generation**: ~830ms (1536 dimensions)
- **Model Listing**: ~340ms (35 models)

## Security Validation

| Security Check | Result | Details |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| Non-root user | ✅ PASS | appuser:1000 |
| Minimal packages | ✅ PASS | Production image stripped |
| File permissions | ✅ PASS | 755 on /app directory |
| No shell access | ✅ PASS | Production hardened |
| Security options | ✅ PASS | no-new-privileges:true |

## Issues Identified

### Non-Critical Issues:
1. **Linting warnings** (22 issues) - Mostly whitespace and line length
2. **Type checking errors** (7 issues) - Missing type annotations
3. **Deprecation warnings** (24 warnings) - httpx client initialization

### Recommendations:
1. Address linting issues in main.py to improve code quality
2. Add missing type annotations for better type safety
3. Update httpx client initialization to use new syntax

## Test Environment

- **Docker Version**: Docker version 27.5.1, build 4e7e1f1
- **Docker Compose**: v2.31.0
- **Host OS**: Linux 6.11.0-28-generic
- **Python Version**: 3.12.11 (in containers)
- **Test Framework**: pytest 7.4.4

## Conclusion

The Docker multi-stage build implementation has passed all critical tests and meets all acceptance criteria. The containerized application demonstrates:

- ✅ Successful builds across all stages
- ✅ Proper security hardening with non-root user
- ✅ Full development environment capabilities
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline compatibility
- ✅ Production-ready deployment with resource limits
- ✅ Complete Ollama SDK compatibility

**Recommendation**: The Docker implementation is ready for production deployment.

## Appendix A: Test Commands Reference

```bash
# Build all stages
for stage in base dev ci prod; do
  docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target $stage -t test:$stage .
done

# Run integration tests
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11438 pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Production deployment
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Resource monitoring
docker stats --no-stream ollama-proxy
```

## Appendix B: Known Limitations

1. ARM architecture support was removed per story requirements
2. One performance test skipped (test_proxy_server_response_time) - requires specific timing conditions
3. Tests require OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to be set
