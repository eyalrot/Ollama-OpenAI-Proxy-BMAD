- Implemented comprehensive security with non-root user (appuser:1000)
- All health endpoints functioning correctly with proper monitoring
- 99.4% test pass rate (162/163 tests passed)

### Process Improvements
- Developer identified and fixed PYTHONPATH issue proactively
- Thorough testing approach with detailed documentation
- Excellent use of BMad agent workflow (SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA)
- Clear separation of implementation (3.6) and testing (3.6.5) stories

### Team Collaboration
- Developer created exceptionally detailed test summary report
- QA provided constructive feedback with actionable recommendations
- Good communication during port conflict troubleshooting

### Notable Successes
- Ollama SDK integration tests passed comprehensively (82/83)
- Resource usage well within limits (99MB < 256MB)
- Professional-quality documentation suitable for stakeholders
- Security implementation exceeded expectations

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ”§

### Technical Challenges
- Port conflicts during testing required manual intervention
- One test failed in .env file loading (OSError: Starting path not found)
- 22 linting warnings and 7 type checking errors remain
- Deprecation warnings in httpx client initialization

### Process Issues
- No automated Docker deployment tests exist (tests/integration/test_docker_deployment.py)
- Manual testing steps could be better automated
- Health endpoint tests missing from test suite

### Communication Gaps
- Initial ARM support requirement was later removed
- Some manual test procedures not fully documented

### Time Management
- Multiple attempts needed to find available ports during testing
- Container cleanup required between test runs

## What We Learned ðŸ“š

### Technical Insights
- PYTHONPATH must be explicitly set in Docker containers for module discovery
- Docker Compose version attribute is obsolete and should be removed
- Port management strategy needed for parallel container testing
- Multi-stage builds significantly reduce image size and improve security

### Process Discoveries
- Breaking testing into separate story (3.6.5) improved focus and quality
- Comprehensive test reports are valuable for stakeholder communication
- BMad agent workflow enables thorough implementation and review

### Team Dynamics
- Developer agents can produce senior-level work with proper guidance
- QA agent adds significant value with constructive review
- Clear story structure leads to better implementation

2. Technical debt cleanup (linting, type annotations)
3. Production deployment automation and monitoring

### Risks to Monitor
1. Dependency deprecation warnings may impact future builds
2. Missing automated tests could allow regressions
3. Port allocation strategy needed for CI/CD environment

## Retrospective Effectiveness
