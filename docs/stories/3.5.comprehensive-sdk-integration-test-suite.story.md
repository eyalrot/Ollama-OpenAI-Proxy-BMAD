# Story 3.5: Comprehensive SDK Integration Test Suite

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a complete test suite validating all Ollama SDK methods,
**so that** I can ensure full compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Test suite covers client.list(), generate(), chat(), and embeddings()
2. Each method is tested with multiple parameter combinations
3. Edge cases like empty prompts and long texts are tested
4. Error scenarios are validated for each endpoint
5. Performance benchmarks compare proxy overhead to direct calls
6. Test report shows 100% SDK method coverage

  - [x] Document all tested SDK methods
  - [x] Generate coverage reports
  - [x] Validate against Ollama SDK documentation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Integration tests were created progressively during Epic 2 and Epic 3 implementation. This story consolidates and completes the comprehensive test suite covering all Ollama SDK methods.

### SDK Integration Test Architecture
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **SDK Integration**: Uses official Ollama Python SDK as test client
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fixtures to start/stop server for live testing
- **Coverage Goals**: 100% Ollama SDK method coverage

### Test Suite Organization
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
**Integration Test Files**:
- `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_list.py` - Model listing tests
- `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_generate.py` - Text generation tests  
- `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_streaming.py` - Streaming response tests
- `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_chat.py` - Chat conversation tests
- `tests/integration/test_ollama_sdk_embeddings.py` - Embeddings tests
- `tests/integration/test_performance_benchmarks.py` - Performance tests

### SDK Methods Covered
**Complete Ollama SDK Coverage**:
1. `client.list()` - Model listing with filtering
2. `client.generate()` - Text generation (streaming & non-streaming)
3. `client.chat()` - Conversational AI with message history
4. `client.embeddings()` - Vector embeddings generation

### Performance Benchmarking
- Response time measurements for all endpoints
- Proxy overhead analysis vs direct OpenAI calls
- Throughput testing under load
- Memory usage profiling

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All tests must be async and use proper fixtures
- Tests run against live server instances (not mocked)
- Comprehensive parameter combination testing
- Edge case and error scenario validation
- Performance thresholds must be met (<100ms overhead)
