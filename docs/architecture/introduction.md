# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Ollama-OpenAI Proxy Service, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Primary Technical Goal:** Create a proxy service that implements the Ollama API specification, allowing the official Ollama SDK to seamlessly communicate with OpenAI-compatible backends without any client-side code changes. Success is measured by complete Ollama SDK compatibility. The service exposes Ollama API endpoints and uses the OpenAI SDK as a client library to communicate with backends.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

N/A - This project is built from scratch without using a starter template. The architecture is custom-designed specifically for the proxy service requirements.
