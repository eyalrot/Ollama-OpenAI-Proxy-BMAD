# Next Steps

## For Implementation

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
1. Set up development environment with Docker and Python 3.12
2. Implement `/api/tags` endpoint
3. Create Ollama SDK integration test for `client.list()`
4. Verify basic proxy functionality

**Phase 2: Core Generation (Week 2)**
5. Implement `/api/generate` endpoint
6. Add streaming support for SSE responses
7. Create comprehensive SDK tests for `client.generate()`
8. Test both streaming and non-streaming modes

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)**
9. Implement `/api/chat` endpoint
10. Implement `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` endpoints
11. Complete SDK compatibility test suite
12. Performance optimization and testing

**Phase 4: Distribution (Week 4)**
13. Build wheel package for distribution
14. Create Docker and Docker Compose configurations
15. Documentation and examples
16. Optional: Publish to PyPI

## Development Prompts

Since this is a backend-only service with no UI components, proceed directly to implementation using the Dev agent with this architecture as reference.

**Dev Agent Prompt:**
Implement the Ollama-OpenAI proxy service following the phased approach in this architecture document. Use Python 3.12 and ensure the project can be deployed via Docker, Docker Compose, and as a Python wheel package.

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Phase 1 First**: Start with `/api/tags` endpoint only
2. **Test with Ollama SDK**: Each endpoint must be tested with the official Ollama Python SDK
3. **Phased Development**: Complete and test each phase before moving to the next
4. **Primary Success Metric**: Existing Ollama SDK code works unchanged when pointed at proxy

**Implementation Order:**
- Phase 1: `/api/tags` - Verify `client.list()` works
- Phase 2: `/api/generate` - Verify `client.generate()` with streaming
- Phase 3: `/api/chat` and `/api/embeddings` - Complete SDK support

Each phase must include integration tests proving Ollama SDK compatibility before proceeding to the next phase.
