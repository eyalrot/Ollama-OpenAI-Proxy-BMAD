# Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Docker 24.0, Docker Compose 2.23
- **Location:** `docker/`
- **Approach:** Containerized deployment with environment-based configuration

## Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Multiple deployment options - Docker, Docker Compose, Python wheel, PyPI
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (or configurable)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment
- Build Docker image with multi-stage build for optimization
- Push to container registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- Deploy single container or orchestrated with Kubernetes

### 2. Docker Compose Deployment
- Local development with hot-reload
- Multi-service deployment with dependencies
- Environment-specific compose files (dev, prod)

### 3. Python Wheel Distribution
- Build universal wheel for distribution
- Include all dependencies in requirements
- Support for offline installation

### 4. PyPI Distribution
- Publish as `ollama-openai-proxy` package
- Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Installation via `pip install ollama-openai-proxy`
- CLI entry point for direct execution

## Environments

- **Development:** Local Docker container with hot-reload enabled - http://localhost:11434
- **Staging:** Containerized deployment with production-like config - Validate before production
- **Production:** Highly available deployment with monitoring - Load balanced, multi-instance

## Environment Promotion Flow

```text
Development -> Staging -> Production

1. Local development with docker-compose
2. Build and test in CI
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run integration tests
5. Manual approval gate
6. Deploy to production
7. Smoke tests and monitoring
```

## Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Container image rollback via orchestrator
- **Trigger Conditions:** Failed health checks, error rate > 10%, manual trigger
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 5 minutes

## Package Distribution

```toml
