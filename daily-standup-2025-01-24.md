**Day**: Continuing Epic 3 Distribution Features

## Team Member Updates

### Developer: Eyal

#### Yesterday's Accomplishments âœ…
- [x] **Epic 1 COMPLETED** (7/7 stories) - Foundation & Core Translation
  - All stories from 1.1 (Project Foundation) to 1.7 (SDK Compatibility) 
  - Test coverage: 87%
- [x] **Epic 2 COMPLETED** (7/7 stories) - Text Generation & Streaming  
  - All stories from 2.1 (/api/generate) to 2.7 (Error Handling)
- [x] **Epic 3 PARTIAL** (3/8 stories) - Advanced Features & Distribution
  - âœ… Story 3.1: /api/chat endpoint implemented
  - âœ… Story 3.3: /api/embeddings endpoints implemented
  - Fixed cosine similarity threshold for embeddings tests
  - Improved error handling in OpenAIService
- [x] **All commits pushed to GitHub** with passing CI/CD
- [x] **Fixed Codecov integration** - handling rate limiting and missing tokens

#### Today's Plan ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] **Current focus**: Continue Epic 3 remaining stories
- [ ] **Story 3.5**: Comprehensive SDK Integration Test Suite
  - Test suite covering all SDK methods (list, generate, chat, embeddings)
  - Performance benchmarks and edge case testing
  - 100% SDK method coverage validation
- [ ] **Story 3.6**: Docker Production Build (if time permits)
  - Multi-stage Docker build optimization
  - Security hardening (non-root user)
  - Health check and Docker Compose setup

#### Blockers/Concerns ðŸš¨
- [ ] No current blockers
- [ ] Need to prioritize remaining Epic 3 stories (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)
- [ ] Epic 3.2 and 3.4 appear to be merged into 3.1 and 3.3 respectively

#### Metrics ðŸ“Š
- **Epic 1**: 7/7 stories completed (100%) âœ…
- **Epic 2**: 7/7 stories completed (100%) âœ…  
- **Epic 3**: 3/8 stories completed (37.5%) ðŸŸ¡
- **Test coverage**: 87% (exceeds 80% target)
- **Build status**: âœ… Latest commit passing
- **CI/CD**: âœ… All checks green (Test workflow success)

## Sprint Progress

### Epic Status Overview
```
Epic 1 (Foundation): â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ 100% COMPLETE âœ…
Epic 2 (Generation): â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ 100% COMPLETE âœ…  
Epic 3 (Distribution): â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 37.5% IN PROGRESS ðŸŸ¡
```

### Remaining Epic 3 Stories
| Story | Priority | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 3.5 SDK Integration Test Suite | High | Not Started | Critical for release quality |
| 3.6 Docker Production Build | High | Not Started | Required for deployment |
| 3.7 Python Package Distribution | Medium | Not Started | PyPI publishing |
| 3.8 Documentation and Examples | Low | Not Started | User onboarding |

### Core Functionality Status âœ…
- âœ… `/api/tags` - Model listing (Epic 1)
- âœ… `/api/generate` - Text generation with streaming (Epic 2)  
- âœ… `/api/chat` - Conversational AI (Epic 3)
- âœ… `/api/embeddings` - Vector embeddings (Epic 3)
- âœ… Full Ollama SDK compatibility proven
- âœ… Translation engine working for all endpoints

### Key Decisions Made
- **Merged related stories**: 3.2 (Chat Translation) merged into 3.1, 3.4 (Embeddings Translation) merged into 3.3
- **Error handling standardized**: Using enhanced error handling framework across all endpoints
- **Virtual environment requirement**: All Python activities must use venv
- **CI/CD resilience**: Added continue-on-error for Codecov to prevent build failures

### Action Items
- [ ] **Eyal**: Implement Story 3.5 (SDK Test Suite) by end of day
- [ ] **Eyal**: Plan Story 3.6 (Docker Production) for tomorrow
- [ ] **Eyal**: Consider if Stories 3.7-3.8 are needed for MVP release

## Focus Areas for Today

### Primary Objective: Story 3.5 - SDK Integration Test Suite
**Why it's critical**: This ensures production readiness and validates all proxy functionality

**Tasks breakdown**:
1. Create comprehensive test coverage for all SDK methods
2. Add performance benchmarks comparing proxy vs direct calls  
3. Test edge cases (empty prompts, long texts, error scenarios)
4. Generate test report showing 100% method coverage
5. Validate all endpoints work correctly with real Ollama SDK

### Secondary Objective: Docker Production Readiness
**If Story 3.5 completes early**, start on production Docker build

---

## Project Health Check

### Technical Health âœ…
- **Energy level**: High - All core functionality working
- **Confidence in epic completion**: High - Clear path forward
- **Code quality**: Strong - 87% test coverage, all tests passing
- **CI/CD stability**: Good - Recent fixes resolved Codecov issues

### Next Steps After Epic 3
Based on PRD, Epic 3 completion delivers:
- Production-ready proxy service
- Full Ollama SDK compatibility  
- Multiple deployment options (Docker, PyPI)
- Complete documentation

**Ready for production deployment once Epic 3 stories 3.5-3.8 are complete!**

**Next Standup**: 2025-01-25 (Tomorrow)
**Sprint Goal**: Complete Epic 3 and prepare for production release
