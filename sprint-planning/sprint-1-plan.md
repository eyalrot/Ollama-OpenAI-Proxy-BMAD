# Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Translation

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days)  
**Sprint Goal**: Establish project foundation and prove core concept with working /api/tags endpoint  
**Total Story Points**: 19 points  
**Team Velocity**: ~10 points/week (assuming 1 developer)

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on building the foundational infrastructure and proving the core translation concept works with the Ollama SDK. By the end of this sprint, we'll have a working proxy that can list models through the Ollama client.

## Daily Schedule

### Week 1
- **Monday (Day 1)**: Project setup, structure, venv
- **Tuesday (Day 2)**: Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD setup
- **Wednesday (Day 3)**: Configuration management, tests
- **Thursday (Day 4)**: OpenAI service wrapper
- **Friday (Day 5)**: Service testing, error handling

### Week 2
- **Monday (Day 6)**: Create /api/tags endpoint
- **Tuesday (Day 7)**: Translation logic, integration tests

## Sprint Metrics

### Burndown Targets
- Day 2: 16 points remaining (3 completed)
- Day 4: 11 points remaining (8 completed)
- Day 6: 8 points remaining (11 completed)
- Day 8: 3 points remaining (16 completed)
- Day 10: 0 points remaining (19 completed)

### Risk Mitigation
1. **OpenAI API Issues**: Have mock data ready for testing
2. **Docker complexities**: Can run locally without Docker initially
3. **CI/CD delays**: Focus on local testing first
4. **SDK compatibility**: Early testing with Ollama SDK

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical Goals**:
   - [ ] Ollama SDK `client.list()` returns models
   - [ ] Response format exactly matches Ollama
   - [ ] Performance overhead < 100ms
   - [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved

2. **Quality Goals**:
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] No critical bugs
   - [ ] Code reviewed
   - [ ] Documentation complete

3. **Sprint Completion**:
   - [ ] All 7 stories completed
   - [ ] Sprint demo successful
   - [ ] Ready for Epic 2
