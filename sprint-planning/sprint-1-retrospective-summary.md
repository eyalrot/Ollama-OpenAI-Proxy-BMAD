# Sprint 1 Retrospective Summary

**Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Translation**  
**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Result**: 19/19 points completed in 1 day âœ…

## What Worked Exceptionally Well ðŸŽ‰

- **BMad SDLC process** - reduced ambiguity and improved development flow
- **Single-day focused sprint** - excellent execution approach
- **Breaking PRD into small stories** - enabled rapid progress
- **Architecture + planning upfront** - solid foundation paid off
- **Integration tests on top of unit tests** - effective testing strategy

## Key Improvements Needed ðŸ”§

### Development Environment
- **Move to dev containers** - eliminate venv management issues
- **Test Docker environment** - wasn't used during sprint
- **Customize VS Code** - enable smooth work beyond Claude Code

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit tests not aligned with official API** - mocks don't match real SDK
- **TDD with official API swagger** - provide specs before implementation
- **Small code changes break many tests** - need more robust test design

### Process & Workflow  
- **Consistent BMad SM workflow** - stop mixing SM and direct approaches
- **Epic definition clarity** - separate PRD from Epic management
- **Auto-commit after story completion** - dev agent should do this consistently
- **Better specifications** - setup details need improvement

## Action Items for Next Sprint ðŸ“‹

**High Priority:**
1. Implement dev container setup
2. Test Docker development environment
3. Use SM agent consistently for all stories

**Medium Priority:**
4. Update architecture docs from Epic 1 learnings
5. Improve unit test alignment with real API specs

## Key Learning ðŸ“š

**Most Important Insight:**  
*"Updating architecture documents from Epic 1 findings made Epic 2 smoother"*

**Next Sprint Capacity**: 20-25 points (based on 19 points/day demonstrated velocity)
